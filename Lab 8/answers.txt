1. Done

2. The iterator is only used when called like this, dereferencing it would
cause an error as it is NOT a pointer.

3. 

// dereference

structName operator*() {  };

//multiply       

structName operator *(const structName&) {  };

4. I do not completely understand this question. I believe there might be 
an issue with using "+ 1" on an iterator as once again, it is different from
a pointer. Throughout the code I notice there is mainly use of increments. 

5. I believe the program will crash because I would be trying to access
	a null member variable.
